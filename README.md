# AI-SCRIPT-WRITER-
An agent-based AI system that generates structured, high-quality scripts from user input by decomposing the creative workflow into specialised cooperating agents.  Instead of a single monolithic generator, this project demonstrates how Agentic AI architecture can improve transparency, control, and reliability in generative content systems.
